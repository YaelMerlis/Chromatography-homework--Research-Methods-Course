## Methods

Mass spectrometry data were uploaded and analyzed using the GNPS (Global Natural Products Social Molecular Networking) platform. The parameters used for generating the molecular network were as follows:
- Precursor Ion Mass Tolerance: 0.01 Da  
- Fragment Ion Mass Tolerance: 0.01 Da

Figure 1: Molecular network visualization including Dioctyl (Cluster Index: 1700, precursor mass: 467.205). Each node represents a unique MS/MS spectrum, and edges represent spectral similarity with annotated neutral mass differences. This network reveals structurally related compounds within the Dioctyl molecular family.

### Spectral Data for Dioctyl (Cluster Index: 1700)

Figure 3: Molecular network visualization including Cyclosporine A (Cluster Index: 2081, precursor mass: 1202.85). Each node represents a unique MS/MS spectrum, and edges represent spectral similarity with annotated neutral mass differences. This network reveals structurally related compounds within the Cyclosporine molecular family

### Spectral Data for Cyclosporine A (Cluster Index: 2081)

## Discussion
Comparing the spectra of the selected compounds highlights clear structural distinctions. Dioctyl, with fewer peaks and simpler fragmentation patterns, contrasts markedly with the complex fragmentation patterns observed for Cyclosporine. The network visualization (Figures 1 and 3) clearly illustrates the close spectral relationships within the Cyclosporine molecular family.
